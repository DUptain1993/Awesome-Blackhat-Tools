Whether you need a way to logically distribute large or complex commands across multiple systems, or if you need a way to remotely administer 1 or more other systems, Legion can help. Legion goes beyond a typical Master/Manager/Slave architecture and makes use of a MeshNetworking approach to help to dynamically route around failed nodes and networking issues. Additionally, it has the ability to allow remote shell access to any node as well as send individual commands to 1 or all of the nodes within the mesh. And of course all the communications are encrypted between the nodes.

📝 **Description:** WarBerryPi was built to be used as a hardware implant during red teaming scenarios where we want to obtain as much information as possible in a short period of time with being as stealth as possible. Just find a network port and plug it in. The scripts have been designed in a way that the approach is targeted to avoid noise in the network that could lead to detection and to be as efficient as possible. The WarBerry script is a collection of scanning tools put together to provide that functionality.
