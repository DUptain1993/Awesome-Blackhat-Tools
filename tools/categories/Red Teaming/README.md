Legion goes beyond a typical Master/Manager/Slave architecture and makes use of a MeshNetworking approach to help to dynamically route around failed nodes and networking issues. Additionally, it has the ability to allow remote shell access to any node as well as send individual commands to 1 or all of the nodes within the mesh. And of course all the communications are encrypted between the nodes.
